Go over the exercies first
Review from Day1
Demo the math functionalities: math.max(),math.min(), math.round(), math.ceil(), math.floor(),math.rand() and much more

Move on to more array functions continuation: forEach, map, filter, reduce, some, every etc. (look at array_problems_continuation file) 

Move to various logical operations:

multiple if
if, if else, else
switch / case
explain return statements

move on to function:

function has name, parameters(optional), return type(optional)
a function can also have another function call(it's called call back function)

Go in details with call back function, explain with 
sort, map, filter, reduce

setTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval

xhr, also have call back function
